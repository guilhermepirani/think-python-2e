'''Code for 9.7.8

Here’s another Car Talk Puzzler 
(http://www.cartalk.com/content/puzzlers):

“I was driving on the highway the other day and I happened to notice my odometer. 
Like most odometers, it shows six digits, in whole miles only. 
So, if my car had 300,000 miles, for example, I’d see 3-0-0-0-0-0.
“Now, what I saw that day was very interesting. 
I noticed that the last 4 digits were palindromic; that is, they read the same forward as backward. 
For example, 5-4-4-5 is a palindrome, so my odometer could have read 3-1-5-4-4-5.

“One mile later, the last 5 numbers were palindromic. 
For example, it could have read 3-6-5-4-5-6. 
One mile after that, the middle 4 out of 6 numbers were palindromic. 
And you ready for this? One mile later, all 6 were palindromic!

“The question is, what was on the odometer when I first looked?”

Write a Python program that tests all the six-digit numbers and prints any numbers that satisfy these requirements.
